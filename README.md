# SparkFun_SX1509_Pi_Library
Modified SparkFun SX1509 I/O Expander Library for use on PI type SBC's

Also added a "C" wrapper.

Original source taken from: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SX1509_Arduino_Library

Use:

make
sudo make install
make demo

I'm using this to control buttons and encoder wheels for the
pihpsdr project from G0ORX: https://github.com/g0orx/pihpsdr
on an Odroid-C1 SBC.
